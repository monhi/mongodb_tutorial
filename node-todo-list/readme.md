## MongoDB CRUD operations using Node.js and express web application platform

This is a sample project to work with mongodb, node.js and express. 
It manages a TODO list by using above technologies.
All CRUD operations are implemented. 

I copy it from following project:

<a href="https://medium.com/@diogo.fg.pinheiro/simple-to-do-list-app-with-node-js-and-mongodb-chapter-1-c645c7a27583"> Link 1 </a>

<a href="https://medium.com/@diogo.fg.pinheiro/simple-to-do-list-app-with-node-js-and-mongodb-chapter-2-3780a1c5b039"> Link 2 </a>

In this project I use local MongoDB database. But in original project, it uses a cloud based one to manage CRUD operations. Both are possible and it just needs to change the link to database in .env file that is placed in root folder.
