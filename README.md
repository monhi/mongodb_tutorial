# MongoDB tutorial

Today, it is very common to use mongoDB as a nosql database in web based projects. Keeping a track of new points and skills about this DB is something that I always handle with MS word documents. But now I think it is good idea to share it as a Github repository. In this way other developers can also use it.

**Setting Path for MongoDB using mongod command**

1. add MongoDB bin folder path to sysem environment path(windows OS),In this way it can be run from anywhere.
2. create d:\mongodb folder and then run mongod.exe --dbpath  d:\mongodb 
3. In above command, I set db path to be in d:\mongodb folder. you can select your own path. 
4. default MongoDB path is in C:\data\db folder. This folder does not exist and you are supposed to create it. 
5.  MongoDBâ€™s default data directory path is /data/db on the drive. Therefore, it is necessary that we provide those directories like so.
